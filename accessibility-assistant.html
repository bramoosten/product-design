        <p class="">Hundreds of thousands of sites throughout the world use Klaviyo forms to gather information from their visitors. With that kind of reach we recognize a duty to end users to make our forms as accessible as possible.
        </p>
              <p>
                When we discovered many Klaviyo forms were not meeting accessibility standards, we took action to build a solution that would help those without familiarity with such standards to learn and resolve common issues with ease. Without sacrificing the flexibility of our builder or introducing barriers that would negatively impact top-level metrics like publish rates and NPS scores, Accessibility Assistant uses a warning system of actionable cards to ensure our users are alerted of potential issues and can resolve them quickly.</p>
                <p>
                  I was the sole designer on this project, working with a product manager, one software engineer, and a user researcher to execute my vision. Development took approximately 2 months and the tool launched to Klaviyo users in April 2023.</p>

<div class="">
  <div class="container-fluid" style="max-width: 768px"> 
      <h2><br>03. Design process</h2>
      <h3>I. Understanding the problem</h3>
<img src="img/paths.jpg" class="img-fluid float-right ml-3 mt" style="width: 30%"> 
      <p>Based on discussions with internal stakeholders and the requirements outlined by our partner, we planned to build out three user journeys, with the career discovery portal being a major feature. We felt this was the best way to address the needs of a wide segment of the user base who may find a job search with no guidance daunting.</p>

        <p>Because many of the users would be using this to search for new career paths it made more sense to directly address the needs of those with uncertainty about their future career prospects who were interested in future work opportunities based on their skills and interests. We also determined that a key functionality would be to deliver relevant job listings post-discovery, aggregated from Jobcase and other partners.</p>

      
      <h3>II. Conducting research</h3>

      <p>To ensure accuracy of the results, I conducted a literature review of papers published by the U.S. Department of Labor around the different variants of the O*NET Interest Profiler. A longer, 60 question version of the quiz is provided but the 30 question version has a degree of accuracy high enough for us to feel like the trade-off on reducing the <img src="img/holland-codes.png" class="img-fluid float-left mr-4 mt-4" style="width: 35%"> time until a user was able to see their results was appropriate. The  
O*NET uses the questions to score respondents on traits of Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional with questions about common tasks.The categories are based on research conducted in the 1950s by psychologist John L. Holland and have been used by the U.S. Department of Labor since the 1990s. </p>
            <p>The O*NET service also provides the framework I used for the industries grid on the job browse page. This experience allows for users to explore careers in different industries as an alternative to the interest profiler and gave us a little more flexibility as far as design went because it didn’t rely on an API.</p>
    
      <img src="img/wv-onet.jpg" class="img-fluid proj-photo">

      <h3>III. Developing the solutions</h3>      
      <p>The main feature of the experience is a career discovery quiz that lets users quickly answer 30 questions and receive career recommendations based upon their answers. With this restriction in mind, I designed 3 options for the quiz with the goal of meeting the requirements of an user experience that is fast, fun to use, and accurate. The accuracy scores are based on the usage of a 1 to 5 scale versus a boolean scale. After a review with stakeholders, we opted to move forward with the third option of quickly tapping through screens with a series of tiles, which struck the right balance between accuracy and speed.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
<div class="">
  <div class="container-fluid" style="max-width: 768px"> 
      <p>The logic of the career quiz is based upon the O*NET Interest Profiler so we were restricted by the limitations of their API, which delivers text, takes input, and returns results based on the information provided. Because of this, we had to move away from a visually rich interface and went with solid tiles for the experience. </p>

      <h3>IV. Prototyping and validation</h3>      

      <p>Using an InVision prototype and UserTesting.com I tested the job discovery with 5 different users in asynchronous testing environments (not moderated.) The insights helped steer the direction of the design and was valuable in correcting some assumptions we had made about communicating the purpose and context of the questions. For example, I originally thought that sorting the questions into pages by the traits outlined above made logical sense but this was more confusing than clarifying to our participants.       <img src="img/invision-prototype.png" class="img-fluid proj-photo">
Additionally, it was clear the visual feedback of changing the color of the selected row from dark to light wasn’t a sufficient indication that it was selected so that was changed to be more responsive.</p>

      <h3>V. Executing on solution</h3>      

      <p>After dispositioning the feedback from the prototype users and our key stakeholders, I worked to arrive at a final design and coordinated with a content strategist to refine the language and instructions. With a hard deadline due to prearranged press commitments I worked closely with the engineering team responsible for building the experience to provide feedback and guidance on the design execution. </p></div>

      <h2><br>04. Challenges
</h2>
      <h3>Time constraints</h3>
      <p>We had about 4 weeks from the time this project was brought to our attention until when it was set to be delivered. Jobcase leadership had arranged for a press conference and media appearances to promote the product at the end of August. With myself as the only designer on the project and a number of parties at Jobcase with a vested stake in the success of the project, there was significant pressure to deliver something polished and fully functional in a short amount of time.
</p>

            <h3>Usage beyond launch</h3>
      <p>Another goal of the project was to eventually roll the interest profiler into a queryless job discovery tool on the Jobcase website. Although we were building the project for citizens of West Virginia, it was important that it could be used with a broader audience down the line. This is one of the reasons we were confident in testing our initial prototypes with a broader public instead of seeking out users from the area we were targeting.
</p>


      <h3>Technical limitations</h3>
      <p>Because of resourcing and time constraints, much of the backend was based on existing work done for a partner in the years prior. This necessitated working within the general framework of the first portal which was a successful strategy for speeding up the time to launch but meant there were limitations on how far we could push the concepts that were being tested. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container-fluid" style="max-width: 768px"> 
      <h2>05. Outcomes</h2>
      <p>The Discover West Virginia Jobs initiative saw a successful launch with Senator Joe Manchin and our CEO Fred Goff appearing together on a live streamed launch on August 28, 2019. This was paired with a press release from Jobcase which was subsequently picked up by several local media outlets in West Virginia. Thousands of visitors completed the self-assessment in the first week and the initiative boosted Jobcase visibility within the state and has been used as an effective tool to promote partnerships with other organizations since launch.</p>
