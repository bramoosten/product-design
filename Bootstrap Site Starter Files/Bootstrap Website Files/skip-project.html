        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Solving the problems everyday workers face is a mission Jobcase prides itself in. With unemployment in the United States hitting record numbers and the workforce facing increasing hurdles, the Jobcase product team was tasked with addressing the upcoming issue of getting millions of employees back to work.</p>
        <p>Skip the Line is an app that allows workers to build a profile, provide some information about their interest and abilities, and complete a background check. The profile is matched against partner jobs and the worker is sent opportunities they're eligible for in the form of job invitations.</p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p class="">
              An app for iOS and Android devices that fits within the Jobcase brand portfolio and allows users to find and apply to relevant jobs after completing a short enrollment flow. This saves time for prospective emplyees and employers.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
                <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p class="">
              From download to employment offer the app must deliver a job search experience that is easy, encouraging, and delightful. It should be extensible to the needs of partners and employers.</p>

    <h3>Role</h3>
      <p class="">
              I was responsible for creating the onboarding, job preferences, and home experiences. I worked with two collaborators to finalize the profile and job search. </p>

    <div class="col-sm-6">
          <h3>Duration</h3>

      <p>The initial phase of the project lasted from March 2020 through June 2020, approximately 3 months. The  beta was launched during the last week of June.

      <h2>Design process</h2>
      <h3>Identify user and stakeholder needs</h3>
      <p>As the #3 career resource in the United States according to ComScore, and a partner to some of America’s most well known employers like Amazon, UPS, and Lyft, Jobcase stays on the pulse of the needs and challenges of employers and workers. While we were focusing on the immediate needs of workers, providing unemployment resources and resources related to navigating COVID-19, the organization gathered qualitative intelligence from partners and members of the Jobcase community about the long term realities of mass unemployment. What happens to the existing employment infrastructure when millions of workers need to fill millions of openings in a short period of time?</p>

            <h3>Develop concept</h3>
      <p>The idea was hatched to build an experience that addressed two key issues a two-sided job market would be facing 6-12 months from now. For the worker, sending out many applications with similar information and waiting for background checks from each before receiving an offer, delaying their time to start by weeks and introducing unnecessary complexity to the job search. For the employer, the time and resources required to hire and onboard can be substantial and the process doesn’t scale easily.</p>

       <h3>Identify partner integration areas</h3>
      <p>While Jobcase excels at some aspects of the candidate acquisition process, blindspots in the background check and applicant tracking steps necessitated a partnership with First Advantage and Workday,  industry-leading players in the human capital space. A key challenge in designing the Skip the Line experience was integrating the First Advantage and Workday capabilities in an app that feels consistent while serving the needs of all stakeholders involved.</p>
                  <img src="img/newspaper-ad-urban-JC-WD-NUL.jpg" class="img-fluid">


      <h3>Build wireframes for client approval</h3>
      <p>With the problems, audience, and broad capabilities outlined, myself and a collaborator built 30-40 low fidelity wireframes to share with stakeholders for feedback and later approval. Beyond business stakeholders we worked and negotiated with technical leads for features and particular visual effects. This step also involved establishing the primary steps flow, profile navigation, log-in experience, job search integration.</p>

      <h3>Develop high fidelity mocks and begin building</h3>
      <p>The wireframes were designed into high fidelity screens with input from product and design leadership. We ensured consistency with our existing experiences with a pattern library. Due to the aggressive timeline we parallized the design and development process with engineering working on screens we were finalizing the day of. This helped accelerate the time to live at the loss of some efficiency with elements that were dropped or changed substantially.</p>      
                        <img src="img/sketch.png" class="img-fluid">


      <h3>Feedback cycles</h3>
      <p>In addition to the design feedback we gathered, dispositioned, and executed on, I worked closely with the developers to provide regular feedback on the app build. This involved reviewing daily builds of the app and writing detailed notes to ensure that the final experience matched the level of polish expected from stakeholders and modern consumers.</p>

      <h3>User testing</h3>
      <p>I conducted eight remote sessions of our first major beta release through Zoom to collect feedback from users within our organization and with jobseekers whose employment was affected by the pandemic. This step largely validated initial assumptions but provided some insight and ideas for future iterations. </p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <h3>Fully remote team</h3>
      <p>The Skip the Line app was the first major project we took on as a remote team. Daily Zoom meetings and regular check-ins were an effective way to keep all team members on top of changes. It did expose drawbacks in our design collaboration and handoff tools that I hope to investigate solutions to for future projects. </p>

            <h3>Expedited design and development process</h3>
      <p>Being a time sensitive project, Skip the Line was the highest priority for our team from April to May 2020. This meant other projects were sidelined or postponed due to the limited output of a 3-person product design team. It also meant that other features and use cases would be delayed, like the employer-facing experience which will lack a front-end at launch.</p>


      <h3>Uncertainty of future needs</h3>
      <p>The app is solving a problem that we expect to exist in the near future. This meant that the amount of research we could do, whether it be for competitive intelligence or from users, was challenging or impossible. That said, upon launch we do plan to gather regular feedback from users as we do with our other products.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="padding">
  <div class="container">
      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <p>We were able to finalize the app in less than two months and already have two dozen interested company partners pending, in addition to existing partners like First Advantage, The National Urban League, and Workday. As America begins re-opening through the summer and fall of 2020, we expect Skip the Line to be a valuable tool for workers of all kinds to return to the workforce.</p>
