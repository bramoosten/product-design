        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p class="">In the Spring of 2020, with unemployment in the United States at record numbers and the workforce facing increasing hurdles ahead to return to work, the Jobcase product team was tasked with addressing the issue of getting millions of employees in the service and labor sectors back to work in short period of time, necessitating a new approach to hiring at scale. The challenge posed was that employers would struggle to process the volume of returning applicants and Skip would serve in place of manually reviewing resumes by the tens of thousand.</p>
        <p class="">The result was called Skip by Jobcase, app that allows workers to build a profile, provide some information about their interest and abilities, and complete a background check, all in about 10 minutes. The profile would then be matched against jobs avaible within the partner company's database and the worker is automatically sent opportunities they're eligible for in the form of job invitations. This solution was meant to introduce a level of automation that wasn't previously adopted to within many of the medium to large scale employers Jobcase works with and better serve the needs of the users.</p>

      <h2>Final Project</h2>

      <h2>Design process</h2>
      <h3>Survey of the landscape</h3>
      <p>While we were focusing on the immediate needs of workers providing unemployment resources and resources to navigate COVID-19, the organization gathered qualitative intelligence from partners and members of the Jobcase community about the long term realities of mass unemployment. What happens to the existing employment infrastructure when millions of workers need to fill millions of openings in a short period of time?</p>

      <p>Initial research steps involved the following:</p>

<ul class="">
  <li class="list-fix">Lorem ipsum</li>
  <li class="list-fix">Phasellus iaculis</li>
  <li class="list-fix">Nulla volutpat</li>
</ul>

<figure class="figure">
  <img src="img/unemployment.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Thousands of users expressed frustration with unemployment within the Jobcase community.">
</figure>


            <h3>Develop concept</h3>
      <p>The idea was hatched to build an experience that addressed two key issues a two-sided job market would be facing 6-12 months from now. For the worker, sending out many applications with similar information and waiting for background checks from each before receiving an offer, delaying their time to start by weeks and introducing unnecessary complexity to the job search. For the employer, the time and resources required to hire and onboard can be substantial and the process doesn’t scale easily.</p>

       <h3>Identify partner integration areas</h3><figure class="figure" style="max-width: 500px;">
  <img src="img/unemployment.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Thousands of users expressed frustration with unemployment within the Jobcase community.">
</figure>

<img src="img/newspaper-ad-urban-JC-WD-NUL.jpg" class="rounded float-right proj-photo p-4" style="max-width: 500px;">
      <p>While Jobcase excels at some aspects of the candidate acquisition process, blindspots in the background check and applicant tracking steps necessitated a partnership with First Advantage and Workday,  industry-leading players in the human capital space. A key challenge in designing the Skip experience was integrating the First Advantage and Workday capabilities in an app that feels consistent while serving the needs of all stakeholders involved.                   
</p>


      <h3>Build wireframes for client approval</h3>
      <p>With the problems, audience, and broad capabilities outlined, myself and a collaborator built 30-40 low fidelity wireframes to share with stakeholders for feedback and later approval. Beyond business stakeholders we worked and negotiated with technical leads for features and particular visual effects. This step also involved establishing the primary steps flow, profile navigation, log-in experience, job search integration.</p>

      <h3>Develop high fidelity mocks and begin building</h3>
      <p>The wireframes were designed into high fidelity screens with input from product and design leadership. We ensured consistency with our existing experiences with a pattern library. Due to the aggressive timeline we parallized the design and development process with engineering working on screens we were finalizing the day of. This helped accelerate the time to live at the loss of some efficiency with elements that were dropped or changed substantially.</p>      
                        <img src="img/sketch.png" class="img-fluid proj-photo">


      <h3>Feedback cycles</h3>
      <p>In addition to the design feedback we gathered, dispositioned, and executed on, I worked closely with the developers to provide regular feedback on the app build. This involved reviewing daily builds of the app and writing detailed notes to ensure that the final experience matched the level of polish expected from stakeholders and modern consumers.</p>

      <h3>User testing</h3>
      <p>I conducted eight remote sessions of our first major beta release through Zoom to collect feedback from users within our organization and with jobseekers whose employment was affected by the pandemic. This step largely validated initial assumptions but provided some insight and ideas for future iterations. </p>

  <div class="container">
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <h3>Fully remote team</h3>
      <p>The Skip by Jobcase app was the first major project we took on as a remote team. Daily Zoom meetings and regular check-ins were an effective way to keep all team members on top of changes. It did expose drawbacks in our design collaboration and handoff tools that I hope to investigate solutions to for future projects. </p>

            <h3>Expedited design and development process</h3>
      <p>Being a time sensitive project, Skip by Jobcase was the highest priority for our team from April to May 2020. This meant other projects were sidelined or postponed due to the limited output of a 3-person product design team. It also meant that other features and use cases would be delayed, like the employer-facing experience which will lack a front-end at launch.</p>


      <h3>Uncertainty of future needs</h3>
      <p>The app is solving a problem that we expect to exist in the near future. This meant that the amount of research we could do, whether it be for competitive intelligence or from users, was challenging or impossible. That said, upon launch we do plan to gather regular feedback from users as we do with our other products.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="padding">
  <div class="container">
      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <p>We were able to finalize the app in less than two months and had interested company partners pending in addition to existing partners like First Advantage, The National Urban League, and Workday. Due to a change in the go-to-market strategy, leadership made the decision to refocus efforts from the Skip app onto a full-featured Jobcase app for launch in the fall of 2020 that incorporates elements from the Skip project.</p>
